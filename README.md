## Memo
   내가 생각하는 것들 (생각없이 일단 적어본다. 완성 후에는 지울 것이다.)
   - 노션을 전체적으로 구현하기는 현실적으로 시간이 부족할 것 같다.
   - 하여 가사나 글을 편리하게 작성할 수 있는 온라인 가사집의 형태를 기획해보려고 한다.
   - 입력한 단어의 모음에 따라 유사 단어가 팝업으로 리스팅되었으면 한다.
   - 맞춤법, 띄어쓰기 등을 필터링 해주는 시스템이 있으면 좋을 것 같다.
   - 아래의 내용은 내가 아직 리액트 초보라 남겨둘 것이다. 하나하나 읽어봐야한다.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
